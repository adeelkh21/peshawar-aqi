I'll provide a clear, text-based roadmap that's easy to follow. Based on your requirements for a simple, effective AQI prediction system, here's the structured plan:

### PHASE 1: DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION (Week 1)
1. Initial Setup
   - Modify existing data collector to fetch 150 days of data
   - Data sources remain same:
     * Weather: Meteostat API
     * Pollution: OpenWeatherMap API
   - Create simple CI/CD pipeline for automated collection
   - Basic error handling and logging

2. Basic Data Processing
   - Convert AQI to numerical values (using existing logic)
   - Basic cleaning (missing values, duplicates)
   - Simple data validation checks
   - Store raw data properly in CSV format

### PHASE 2: FEATURE ENGINEERING (Week 2)
1. Core Feature Set (Keeping it Simple)
   - Weather Features:
     * Temperature
     * Humidity
     * Wind Speed
     * Pressure
   
   - Pollution Features:
     * PM2.5
     * PM10
     * NO2
     * O3
   
   - Basic Time Features:
     * Hour of day
     * Day of week
     * Is weekend flag
   
   - Simple Lag Features:
     * 24-hour lag for main pollutants
     * 24-hour lag for weather

2. Feature Analysis
   - Run SHAP analysis to identify key features
   - Remove highly correlated features
   - Document feature importance
   - Keep only features that significantly impact predictions

### PHASE 3: FEATURE STORE SETUP (Week 3)
1. Hopsworks Integration
   - Set up Hopsworks connection
   - Create feature groups for:
     * Weather features
     * Pollution features
     * Time-based features
   - Store only important features (based on SHAP)
   - Implement basic feature validation

### PHASE 4: MODEL DEVELOPMENT (Week 4)
1. Data Preparation
   - Train/test split (70/30)
   - Simple validation strategy
   - Prepare data for 24h, 48h, and 72h predictions

2. Model Implementation (3 Models)
   - RandomForest:
     * Baseline model
     * Focus on interpretability
     * Simple hyperparameter tuning

   - XGBoost:
     * Second model
     * Handle missing values
     * Basic parameter optimization

   - LightGBM:
     * Third model
     * Fast training
     * Simple configuration

3. Model Evaluation
   - Primary metric: R² (target 75%)
   - Secondary metrics: RMSE, MAE
   - Compare model performances
   - Select best performing model

### PHASE 5: PRODUCTION PIPELINE (Week 5)
1. Prediction Pipeline
   - Hourly data collection
   - Automated feature computation
   - Model prediction generation
   - Basic error handling

2. CI/CD Implementation
   - Automated data collection
   - Basic data validation
   - Simple model retraining triggers
   - Error notification system

### PHASE 6: MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE (Week 6)
1. Basic Monitoring
   - Track prediction accuracy
   - Monitor data quality
   - Check system health
   - Log important metrics

2. Simple Optimization
   - Weekly model performance review
   - Basic feature importance tracking
   - Simple model retraining when needed

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. Primary Goals:
   - Achieve 75% R² score
   - Reliable 72-hour predictions
   - Stable data collection
   - Functional feature store

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Clean, documented code
   - Basic error handling
   - Simple monitoring system
   - Automated data pipeline

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Development Approach:
   - Start with basics, add complexity only if needed
   - Test each component thoroughly
   - Document key decisions
   - Regular validation checks

2. Quality Assurance:
   - Data validation at each step
   - Regular accuracy checks
   - System health monitoring
   - Performance tracking

This roadmap focuses on simplicity and effectiveness, avoiding unnecessary complexity while maintaining robust prediction capabilities. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation for the AQI prediction system.
