   - Time-based feature importance for different prediction horizons (24h, 48h, 72h)

2. **Feature Selection Strategy**
   - Separate feature sets for different prediction horizons
   - Remove highly correlated features (>0.95 correlation)
   - Keep domain-important features regardless of statistical importance

### Step 2: Baseline Model Development

   - ARIMA: For pure time series patterns
   - SARIMA: To capture daily/weekly seasonality
   - VAR (Vector Autoregression): For multivariate relationships

2. **Simple ML Models**
   - Linear Regression: Baseline performance
   - Ridge/Lasso: Handle multicollinearity
   - Decision Trees: Capture non-linear relationships

   - Hyperparameter optimization
   - Feature importance analysis

2. **XGBoost**

   - Custom loss functions for different horizons
   - Learning rate scheduling

3. **LightGBM**
   - Leaf-wise growth for better accuracy
   - Categorical feature handling
   - GPU acceleration if available

### Step 4: Deep Learning Models
1. **LSTM Networks**
   - Sequence length optimization
   - Multi-head prediction
   - Attention mechanisms

2. **Transformer Models**
   - Self-attention for temporal patterns
   - Position encoding for time features
   - Multi-horizon prediction heads

### Step 5: Ensemble Methods
1. **Stacking**
   - Level 1: Base models (RF, XGB, LGBM)
   - Level 2: Meta-learner (Linear/Ridge)
   - Separate stacks for different horizons

2. **Weighted Averaging**
   - Dynamic weights based on recent performance
   - Horizon-specific weighting
   - Uncertainty-based weighting

### Step 6: Model Evaluation Framework
1. **Cross-Validation Strategy**
   - Time-based cross-validation
   - Rolling window validation
   - Out-of-time validation

2. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Primary: R² (target 75%)
   - Secondary: RMSE, MAE
   - Custom metrics:
     - Horizon-specific accuracy
     - Direction accuracy
     - Peak prediction accuracy

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Error analysis by time of day
   - Error analysis by AQI level
   - Model confidence intervals

### Implementation Approach:

1. **Step-by-Step Development**
   - Start with baseline models
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Validate each step thoroughly

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate modules for each model type
   - Common evaluation framework
   - Reusable preprocessing components

3. **Validation Strategy**
   - Initial: 70/30 time-based split
   - Cross-validation: 5-fold time series CV
   - Final: Out-of-sample validation

4. **Performance Goals**
   - 24h ahead: Target 80% R²
   - 48h ahead: Target 75% R²
   - 72h ahead: Target 70% R²
